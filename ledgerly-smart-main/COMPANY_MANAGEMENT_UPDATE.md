# Company Management Update

## Overview
This update adds edit and delete functionality to the company management system with soft delete capability using an `isactive` column.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Added `isactive` BOOLEAN column to the `companies` table
- Default value: `true`
- Used for soft delete functionality

### 2. Frontend Features Added

#### Edit Company Functionality
- **Edit Modal**: Form to update company details (name, GST, address)
- **Validation**: Required fields validation
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates after successful edit
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for success/error states

#### Delete Company Functionality
- **Soft Delete**: Companies are marked as inactive (`isactive = false`) instead of being permanently deleted
- **Confirmation Dialog**: User-friendly confirmation before deletion
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and toast notifications
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains referential integrity for existing bills

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- **Interactive Buttons**: Edit and delete icons are now clickable
- **Toast Notifications**: Success and error feedback using react-hot-toast
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Database Schema
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the `database_schema_update.sql` script
4. Verify the `isactive` column was added to the `companies` table

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install react-hot-toast
```

### Step 3: Code Changes
The following files have been updated:
- `src/pages/Companies.tsx` - Main functionality implementation
- `database_schema_update.sql` - Database schema update script

## Features

### Edit Company
- Click the edit (pencil) icon on any company card
- Modify company name, GST number, or address
- Click "Update Company" to save changes
- Form validation ensures required fields are filled

### Delete Company
- Click the delete (trash) icon on any company card
- Confirm deletion in the dialog
- Company is soft deleted (marked as inactive)
- Company disappears from the active companies list

### Data Filtering
- Only active companies (`isactive = true` or `null`) are displayed
- Deleted companies are filtered out automatically
- Backward compatibility with existing records

## Benefits

1. **Data Safety**: Soft delete prevents accidental data loss
2. **Audit Trail**: Deleted companies can be tracked
3. **Referential Integrity**: Existing bills remain linked to companies
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive edit and delete workflows
5. **Performance**: Efficient queries with indexed `isactive` column

## Future Enhancements

1. **Restore Functionality**: Admin panel to restore deleted companies
2. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple companies for batch operations
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by active/inactive status
4. **Audit Log**: Track who deleted/edited companies and when

## Testing

1. **Add Company**: Verify new companies are created with `isactive = true`
2. **Edit Company**: Test updating company details
3. **Delete Company**: Verify soft delete works and company disappears from list
4. **Database Check**: Confirm `isactive` column is properly set in database
5. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid data and network errors

## Notes

- The `isactive` column defaults to `true` for new companies
- Existing companies without the column will be treated as active
- Deleted companies are not permanently removed from the database
- All operations include proper error handling and user feedback
